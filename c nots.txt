--> C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

-->it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

-->The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not

-->A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand

-->#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}

-->C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

-->printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example, it will output "Hello World!".

-->New Lines
To insert a new line, you can use the \n character:

-->   \t	Creates a horizontal tab	
      \\	Inserts a backslash character (\)	
      \"	Inserts a double quote character

--> Single-line Comments
    Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
--> C Multi-line Comments
    Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

-->C Variables
   In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes

-->Declaring (Creating) Variables--- int myNum = 15;

--> Format Specifiers
    // Create variables
int myNum = 15;            // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99;   // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';       // Character

// Print variables
printf("%d\n", myNum);
printf("%f\n", myFloatNum);
printf("%c\n", myLetter);

--> Change Variable Values
    // Create a variable and assign the value 15 to it
int myNum = 15;

// Declare a variable without assigning it a value
int myOtherNum;

// Assign the value of myNum to myOtherNum
myOtherNum = myNum;

// myOtherNum now has 15 as a value
printf("%d", myOtherNum);

-->  Add Variables Together
    int x = 5;
    int y = 6;
    int sum = x + y;
    printf("%d", sum);

--> Declare Multiple Variables
   int x, y, z;
   x = y = z = 50;
   printf("%d", x + y + z);
